K116 Rules of Engagement (RoE)
Last Updated: March 23, 2024
.
Please speak with the Council about any issues or questions you have with the following. 
- All players of K116 should always uphold this RoE
- Clan leadership is responsible for educating their clan to follow the RoE
- Players in Computer Generated Clans (CGC) are encouraged to join Human-made clans
- Players have 12 hours to read and understand the new RoE rules



1. GENERAL RULES
1.1 - The Kingdom is always at Peace, except during the first 2 days of the Clash of Thrones (CoT) event
1.2 - Scouts and Attacks are illegal within k116 during Peace Time
1.3 - Players found repeatedly violating/abusing the RoE or working with other Kingdoms to bypass the RoE will be subject to a penalty, at the discretion of the judges, and may be outlawed in this kingdom completely


1.4 - Members of human-made clans, who are not outlaws, have protection under the RoE.  A human-made clan is one which is join by request only and has “We follow the K116 RoE’ in their description, and isn’t an Outlaw Clan
1.5 - Computer Generated Clans (CGC) and Clanless have limited protections in the ROE - players under 200k cannot be attacked except by players under 200K at the time of the attack, or if they attacked first (With a Battle report). Others receive no protection
1.6 - All clans must have a listed diplomat, who is a Superior or Leader of that clan, otherwise the Clan Leader will assume that role.  Only the Diplomat or Clan Leader, and the involved parties, will have standing in cases with the K116 Court.  All Diplomats and Clan Leaders MUST join the channel ‘K116 Diplomacy’


1.7 - The K116 Court is made up of Judges who act under the authority of the K116 Council.  Judges are appointed or removed by decree of the Council.  They process and rule on cases as defined in RoE 4.2
1.8 - No clan may harbour an outlaw player, and must remove Outlaws player at the request of the court or may become Outlaw Clans
1.9 - The Council clans and their families have a NAP in place with every human-made clan of the kingdom.  Any attacks by them or on them will be treated as violation of the RoE and dealt with under the resolution process in section 4.  They may still retaliate (4.1), help close a hostile portal (3.1), and remove players from owned or registered resource tiles (2.2, 2.4, 2.6).  The Council is made up of the top 9 clans of k116 by might, this list is updated every CoT voting day when a new King is elected.  Council clans will be listed in Additional Information at the end of the RoE
1.10 - Any Council family member clan whose Leader or Diplomat posts 'Bar Fight' to 'K116 Bar Fight' and has '#bar-fight' in their clan description next to the k116 RoE will remove that clans protection and restrictions under RoE 1.9.  They may attack and be attacked as any other clan of k116 under the RoE.  This will last until the end of the current CoT as a minimum, and must be cancelled with 'Cancel Bar Fight' to the same chat and the removal of #bar-fight.  Bar fight may not be declared for the last 12 hours of a CoT event


2. RULES OF ENGAGEMENT, INCLUDING DURING CoT and KvK
2.1 - Clan marches against other players are illegal*
A clan march is defined as any player attacking another K116 player with reinforcements

2.2 - All resources, including gold, tar, silver, food, wood, stone and iron in any form, and portals inside a clan territory belong to that clan and are protected
Crypts, arenas, citadels and monsters are not resources, and are thus open to everyone
2.3 - Computer generated resource tiles that are outside of clan territories are owned by the first to get there, and they cannot be kicked off. If you leave that tile, then it is open for others to take
2.4 - Any resource tile made by a player with blue prints belong to that player.  If another player occupies that tile the owner can remove the player themselves or ask another player to remove them.  Proof of ownership at the time of the attack must be provided, a screenshot will be taken as proof
See Appendix 1 for identification of player created titles



2.5 - Clan buildings are not to be attacked at any time
Attacks on clan buildings, including forts, will be subject to the following penalties, payable to the attacked clan
- Scouting - 1m silver
- Attack without destroying - 10m silver
- Attacking and destroying - 10m each of silver, iron, wood, stone

2.6 - You may have 1 Dragon Mount (DM) or Well Spring (WS) per 24 hours period that is outside of your clans area
DM must be registered in ‘K116 Gold Reg Only’ and Tar in ‘K116 Tar Reg Only'

Once registered you have 15 minutes to occupy the DM or WS
You may remove or have removed a player on an DM or WS you have legally registered
2.7 - No ingot collection is authorized without the express consent of a clan leader or superior. 
It is each clan's responsibility to uphold tax collection and ensure their members do not hoard.




3. PORTALS, PEACE TIME, WAR TIME, KvK
3.1 - Any hostile portals, regardless of status, during War Time or Peace Time may be closed with NO might restrictions by anyone

3.4 - No scouts or attacks are allowed inside the kingdom during Peace Time, unless pre-arranged (e.g. CP Runs) or permitted elsewhere in the RoE (e.g. hostile portals)
Violations are subject to RoE 4.1 and 4.2 for resolution

4. RoE VIOLATIONS — DO NOT APPROACH THE COURT DIRECTY
4.1 - Illegal attacks are subject to retaliation or compensation (not both)
Silver is generally used to compensate, and it's best to come to a solution BOTH parties agree is fair
4.2 - RoE violations should be resolved between clans and players first
If players, diplomats, and leaders cannot resolve the situation within 24 hours, the Battle Report must be posted to the ‘K116 Court Room’ chat
Cases beyond 48 hours old will not be reviewed by the Court, except in exceptional circumstance
The K116 Court will process cases within 48 hours

Outlaw status will remain in place until the player is pardoned, after compensation is paid




4.3 - Compensation
- DM & WS : 3m silver plus gold mines equivilent to the gold or tar taken (players can’t make tar so gold is a proxy)
- Illegal attacks : Half of current might paid in silver (min 2M max 25M) plus restitution of the captured any resources
- The rebuilding cost for troops killed will be paid by the attacker in each case, as determined by the Court

,
Identifying Computer and Player tiles
Tile level 30 and above are always player created
Tiles level 25 of under:
Check the tile type, players can only create on a tile with the same rss bonus i.e.
- Sand will build a Village which produces Silver
- Plains will build a Farmer's House which will produce Food
- Hilly Meadow (looking rocky) will build a Quarry which will produce Stone
- Trees will build a Sawmill which will produce Wood
- Mountains will produce a Mine that will produce Iron
- A computer made village 25 will have 1m silver, a player one 5m
- All tiles can have gold mines, but a 'gold mine' is always player made (they are Dragon Mounds in the wild)
A player build rss tile will always end in a 0 or 5 
If you're not sure, ask your clan leadership or an experienced player
