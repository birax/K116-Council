Last Updated: 12th November 2023
.
Please speak with the Council about any issues or questions you have with the following. They are open to change. (ADD CHAT ‘K116 ROE Chat’)
* ALL players of K116 should always uphold this RoE
* Clan leadership is responsible for educating their clan to follow the RoE
* Players in Computer Generated Clans (CGC) are encouraged to join Human-made clans
* Players now have 12 hours to read and understand the new RoE rules


1 GENERAL RULES
1.1 K116 is governed by the K116 Council, and titles handed out among the clans
1.2 The Kingdom is at Peace Time apart from the Clash Of Thrones (CoT) first 2 days only
1.3 Scouts and Attacks on players in human-made clans in the kingdom are illegal outside of War Time
1.4 Players found repeatedly violating/abusing the RoE or working with other Kingdoms to bypass the RoE will be subject to a penalty, at the discretion of the K116 Council, and may be outlawed in this kingdom completely



1.5 Only members of human-made clans, who are not outlaws, have protection under the RoE.  A human-made clan is one which is join by request only and has “We follow the K116 RoE’ in their description, and isn’t an Outlaw Clan
1.6 Computer Generated Clans (CGC) and Clanless have limited protections in the ROE - players under 200k can not be attacked unless you are under 200K at the time of the attack, or they attack you first (A battle report must be provided to show they attacked first). Others receive no protection
1.7 All clans must have a listed diplomat, who is a Superior or Leader of that clan, otherwise the Clan Leader will assume that role.  Only the Diplomat or Clan Leader, and the involved parties, will have standing in cases with the K116 Court.  All Diplomats and Clan Leaders MUST join the channel ‘K116 Diplomacy’


1.8 The K116 Court is made up of 6 Judges who act under the authority of the K116 Council.  Judges are appointed or removed by decree of the K116 Council.  They process and rule on cases as defined in RoE 4.2
1.9 No clan may harbour an outlaw player, and must remove Outlaws player at the request of the court or may become Outlaw Clans


2 ALL TIMES IN THE KINGDOM, INCLUDING CoT AND KvK
2.1 CLAN MARCHES AGAINST OTHER PLAYERS ARE ILLEGAL*
A clan march is defined as any player attacking another K116 player with reinforcements.  Clan marches against portals from other kingdoms, or cities in other kingdoms are permitted
* Pre-arranged Conquest Point (CP) Runs and Exchanges are permitted, and in fact encouraged, provided proof of prior arrangement can be provided
2.2 All resources, including gold, tar, silver, food, wood, stone and iron in any form, and portals inside a clan territory belong to that clan and are protected.  Crypts, arenas, citadels and monsters are no resource, and so are not protected and open to everyone


2.3 CLAN BUILDINGS ARE NOT TO BE ATTACKED AT ANY TIME. ATTACKING CLAN BUILDINGS WILL MEAN INSTANT OUTLAW STATUS (Must be proven with a Battle Report).  Attacks on clan buildings, including forts, will be subject to the following penalties, payable to the attacked clan (a battle report must be provided, the offender pays the taxes).
* Scouting - 1m silver
* Attack without destroying - 10m silver
* Attacking and destroying - 10m each of silver, iron, wood, stone
Attacks on clan buildings in other Kingdoms are only allowed in retaliation on ours (a Battle Report must be provided), or with the express permission of the K116 Council



2.4 Resource tiles that are outside of clan territories are owned by the first to get there, and they cannot be kicked off. If you leave that tile, then it is open for others to take
2.5 You may have 1 Dragon Mount (DM) or Well Spring (WS) per 24 hours period that is outside of your clans area
DM must be registered in ‘K116 Gold Reg Only’ and Tar in ‘K116 Tar Reg Only'
Registration must be the final 2 digits of the X and Y coordinate
e.g. a DM or WS at K:116 X:404 Y:784 would be registered as 04,84
Once registered you have 15 minutes to occupy the DM or WS
You may remove or have removed a player on an DM or WS you have legally registered


2.6 Any player city level 29 or under, found with more than 20,000 (20k) ingots, or city level 30 or over, found with more than 35,000 (35k) ingots, may be attacked by anyone, without warning, to collect said taxes. Tax collecting may take place through portals, including those for events or inside clan territories
.
Tax collecting is not permitted during CoT and KvK
.
Those collecting taxes need to provide a battle report showing that the offender met the ingot requirement or the attack will be considered illegal



3 PORTALS, PEACE TIME, WAR TIME, KvK
3.1 Any hostile portals, regardless of status, during War Time or Peace Time may be closed with NO might restrictions by anyone. A hostile portal is a portal that has been used to launch an attack and/or scout. A battle report from the portal must be provided
3.2 Event Portals (used for Doomsday, Shadow Invasion, etc, excluding The Great Hunt.) are protected and can remain until they expire (including those at or on a clan’s territory). Event Portals may ONLY be attacked if it becomes hostile as defined in 3.1 or for tax collection as 2.6
3.3 Portals on a clan’s own territory are to be always PROTECTED from attacks, even if defined as hostile in 3.1
.
PEACE TIME
3.4 No scouts or attacks are allowed inside the kingdom during Peace Time, unless pre-arranged (e.g. CP Runs) or permitted elsewhere in the RoE (e.g. hostile portals), to help players and the kingdom grow between CoT events. Violations are subject to RoE 4.1 and 4.2 for resolution



WAR TIME - Clash for the Throne (CoT) first 2 days only (not voting day)
3.5 Players can only attack within 50% of their might or higher
3.6 Any player can hit someone above their level, but there is a 24 hour window where attacks can be returned by that player  for the duration of war time event in retaliation, on a one-to-one basis regardless of might.  All attacks and/or retaliations must stop at the beginning of voting day
3.7 Cities and portals with Hero Ayrin selected (red-haired water walker) are protected from attacks,, unless they have been or become hostile within this CoT - with that player attacking within the kingdom or an attack being launched within the kingdom from the portal.  Once deemed hostile, the battle report will be listed in ‘K116 Hostile WW’ and they may then be attacked as any other player for the rest of that CoT only



WAR TIME - Clash of Kingdoms (KvK) only
3.8 The kingdom is at peace, all clans are allied with each other in defence of K116
3.9 All portals from other kingdoms are considered hostile, to be reported in Kingdom Chat and closed, including by clan march (see 2.1)


4.  RoE VIOLATIONS — DO NOT APPROACH THE K116 COUNCIL DIRECTLY
4.1 Illegal attacks are subject to retaliation or compensation (not both). Silver is generally used to compensate, and it's best to come to a solution BOTH parties agree is fair
4.2 RoE violations should be resolved between clans and players first
If players, diplomats, and leaders can not resolve the situation within 24 hours, post the Battle Report to the ‘K116 Court’ chat
Cases beyond 48 hours old will not be reviewed by the K116 Court, except in exceptional circumstance agreed between the K116 Court and K116 Council
The K116 Court will process cases within 48 hours
Any player reporting a violation who doesn’t respond to the K116 Court within 24 hours of their message will have their claim dismissed
Rulings for Outlaw Clans will be referred to the K116 Council.  Outlaw status will remain in place until the player is pardoned, after compensation is paid or as determined by the K116 Council



4.3 Compensation:
DM & WS - 3m silver plus gold mines equivilent to the gold or tar taken (players can’t make tar so gold is a proxy)
.
Illigal attacks - Half of current might paid in silver (min 2M max 25M) plus give return captured any resources
.
The rebuilding cost for troops killed will be paid by the attacker in each case, as determined by the Court


5. FINAL AUTHORITY AND DECREES
5.1 In all matters, the King and Chair of the Council shall have final ruling on all conflict/clarification and RoE changes, should the K116 Council not be able to agree. Only the Council Chair or King may issue a Clan level Outlaw Decree or Pardon
